- org.annas.graph - a package providing graph data structures and algorithms

Work on the framework's improvement is progressive, this means that development is well underway to the next stable release. To track the progress you may track source repository's log and view the milestones.

The library is provided as source code and compiled jars. In addition to this some harness's are provided in the repository for testing and example of how to use the framework. The framework uses junit in ensure a rigourous process of testing and backwards compatibility.
