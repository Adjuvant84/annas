Currently annas consists of two packages;\r\n* org.annas.graph - a package providing graph data structures and algorithms\r\n* org.annas.math - a package containing a range of mathematical function.\r\n\r\nWork on the framework's improvement is progressive, this means that development is well underway to the next stable release. To track the progress you may track source repository's log and view the milestones.\r\n\r\nThe library is provided as source code and compiled jars.
